* Zen-mode overview
zen-mode is Emacs is a concentration aid for Emacs.

I bind zen-mode to f11 like this:

(global-set-key [f11] 'zen-set-state)

F11 means full-screen in many applications, and one zen-aspect is fullscreen.

** bugs
*** TODO Currently Zen mode cant see the difference between a maximized
 frame and a fullscreen frame. This is because of a limitation in
 Emacs, which will be fixed future-ish. The end result is that
 currently Zen will probably not do what you expect if you enter zen
 while in a maximized frame. 

 doesnt remember previous window size and position always

*** TODO There are some problems in the Compiz WM, (and maybe other WM:s)
 regarding fullscreen: When selecting another workspace temporarily
 and going back, Emacs does not cover the wm panels as it should.
 This can be resolved with alt-tab a bit, but its annoying.  In
 Metacity it works well. Maybe Zen could learn to work around these
 WM:s

** new features
*** TODO play trance inducing track with EMMS
I have my 
(emms-play-file
"/home/joakim/build_myprojs/sbagen/examples/jave/ts-brain-delta-nopink.sbg")


*** TODO more states that accumulate
*** DONE zen-more and zen-less

    CLOSED: [2011-03-15 Tue 23:57]
 predetermined settings. (c-u NUMBER m-x zen-mode),
NUMBER is the Zen state. The features for each state is configurable

*** DONE utilize custom-themes
    CLOSED: [2011-03-15 Tue 23:57]
The custom theme code in Emacs 24 is nicely demonstrated by
color-themes. Re-use this facility and scrap Zen:s limited in-built
feature.

themable:
scroll-bar-mode menu-bar-mode tool-bar-mode 

needs work:
frame-mode

"Allow more than one theme at a time"
enable-theme
custom-theme-load-path
customize-create-theme
`:set SETFUNCTION'
custom-theme-visit-theme

although one could have any number of zen-states, I want a couple of
usable defaults.

**** zen-master
3
Zen-master mode, like writeroom mode. 
it turns all distractions off, including modeline.
   (setq mode-line-format nil)
   (setq-default mode-line-format nil)
**** zen-deep
2
no menubor toolbar or scrollbar. fullscreen
**** zen-light
1
maximized
**** zen-wordly
0
    all zen-ness is disabled. 
*** DONE encumbered URLs 
    CLOSED: [2011-03-15 Tue 23:57]
polipoli is a webproxy which has a forbiddenurls feature, which is a
file with regexps of forbidden urls. zen can handle this with
customize. The config file will be
generated and the file reloaded.

each url shall have a zen state. This could possibly be managed as a
theme variable.

a problem is that the configuration and reload requires root
privileges on Fedora(and thus probably many other distributions also) 

/etc/polipo/forbidden 
pgrep polipo|xargs kill -SIGUSR1
service polipo reload


*** TODO support https encumbering
polipo can also encumber https urls but that requires a new file + a
polipo patch entering the polipo repo soonish maybe.
*** TODO encumbered buffers
*** TODO advice some modes like ERC so as not to
  interrupt while in Zen, also dont Gnus while in Zen. You are
  supposed to concentrate :)

*** TODO procrastination inhibitor. Enter a Zen state  and dont leave until
 youv'e actually produced someting useful. For instance, 15 minutes
 must pass and some useful buffer must grow by a number of bytes
 before you can begin wasting time again.

*** TODO implicit zen state shifting 
lessening neuralogical procrastenating reward. 

Its easier to describe with an example. You want to Gnus rather than
do whatever more fruitful endeavor you are doing. Gnus is inhibited in
your current zen state. However, you don't need to change zen state
manually to go to a zen state where Gnus is allowed. It is done
automatically. You do, however, have to suffer a synthetic 30 second
delay before arriwing in the Gnus buffer. Zen state is changed
automatically after that. If you quit before the delay expires you
stay in your current zen state.
